Description: Â When making a combat check that does not involve either using the Gunnery skill or operating a non-starship weapon, the character may add a Force dice no greater than their Force rating to the check. The character may spend a Force point to add an advantage result, or five Force points to add a triumph result (character's choice), to the result. Advantage results gained in this way cannot be used to recover strain.

A character who has purchased this talent automatically gains 1 Conflict at the beginning of a game session.
