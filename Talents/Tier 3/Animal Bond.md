# Animal Bond
Tier: 3
Quality: Base
Activation: Passive
Ranked: Yes
Description: Through the Force, the character creates a bond with a single animal with which they are currently interacting. This cannot be done during structured encounters. This animal must have a silhouette equal to or smaller than half the character's Force rating when the bond is created, rounded down (this means a character with Force rating 1 could only bond with a silhouette 0 animal). The bond persists as long as the character chooses it to, although at the GM's discretion, the bond may also be broken due to abusive treatment or other extenuating circumstances.

As long as the bond persists, the animal remains near the character, and the controlling player dictates the animal's overall behaviour (although, since the animal is only bonded with the character, not dominated, it may still perform certain inconvenient actions such as scratching furniture, consuming rations, and marking territory). Once per round in structure encounters, the character may spend one maneuver to direct their animal in performing one action and one maneuver. The animal must be within hearing and visual range of the character (generally medium range) to do this. Otherwise, the animal does not contribute to the encounter. The specifics of its behaviour are up to the player and GM.

For every additional rank of Animal Bond your character has, increase the amount of animals that you can bond with by one. The total silhouette of Animals should never exceed a characters Force Rating, (Silhouette 0 counting as 1).


While an animal companion may make sense in many settings, in a futuristic setting it may make more sense for the “animal” to be a robot or drone, for example.
