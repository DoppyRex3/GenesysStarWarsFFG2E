Description: The character may take a Terrify action, making a **Hard Coercion check** and rolling Force dice no greater than Force rating as part of the check. If successful, one target per success within medium range of the character is disoriented until the end of the next round. The character may spend two advantage results to increase the duration of disorientation for all affected targets by one round, and may spend a Force point to immobilize an affected target until the end of the next round. A character who has purchased this talent automatically gains 1 Conflict at the beginning of a game session.
