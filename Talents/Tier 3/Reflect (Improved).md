# Reflect (Improved)
Tier: 3
Quality: Improved
Activation: Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)
Ranked: No
Description: When the character suffers a hit from a Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), or Gunnery combat check and uses the Reflect incidental to reduce the damage from that hit, after the attack is resolved, the character may spend a despair or three threats to automatically hit one target within medium range, dealing the same damage as the hit from the initial ranged attack.

The initial ranged attack's hit must be one that can be reflected and redirected (generally only blaster weapons or other energy attacks fall into this category; anything else is subject to GM oversight). This talent may not be used if the original attack incapacitates the character.
