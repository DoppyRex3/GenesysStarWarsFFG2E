Description: Once per encounter when riding a beast, the character may perform a Soothing Tone action, attempting anÂ **Average Piloting (Riding) check**. If successful, the beast the character is riding recovers strain equal to success results on the check (or heals that number of wounds if it does not have a strain threshold).
