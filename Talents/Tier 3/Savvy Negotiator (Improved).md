# Savvy Negotiator (Improved)
Tier: 3
Quality: Improved
Activation: Active
Ranked: No
Description: While engaged in a debate or argument, the character may take a Savvy Negotiator action to make aÂ **Hard Negotiation check**. If the check is successful, one bystander or observer per rank of Savvy Negotiator sees one of the opponent's points (chosen by the character) as maliciously unreasonable.

The GM has the final say as to whether bystanders could see a point as unreasonable, based on who those bystanders are and what the point is (for example, an Imperial officer would not likely see the argument that the Rebel Alliance needs to be defeated militarily as unreasonable). In these cases, the GM can suggest a modified version of that argument that would be more believable (said Imperial officer may still want to defeat the Alliance, but may concede that using weapons like the Death Star is barbaric).
