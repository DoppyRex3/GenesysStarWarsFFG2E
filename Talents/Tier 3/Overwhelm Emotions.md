Description: When the character performs a Charm, Coercion, or Deception check, they may include a Force dice equal to their Force rating. Each light Force point adds a success result to Charm checks. Each dark Force point adds a success result to Coercion or Deception checks. However, every two light Force points add a failure result to Coercion or Deception checks, and every two dark Force points add a failure result to Charm checks. This does not apply to targets immune to Force powers.
