# Street Smarts (Improved)
Tier: 3
Quality: Improved
Activation: Active (Action)
Ranked: No
Description: Once per session, the character may perform the Improved Street Smarts action. They make a **Formidable Streetwise** or **Knowledge (Underworld) check**, reducing the difficulty once per rank of Street Smarts. If successful, the GM must reveal one vital clue pertaining to a current mystery the character is attempting to solve.

The clue could be something that the character could not normall find out, but does not have to be the full answer to the mystery (it should be something that cancels a false lead and otherwise helps move the story along). The GM should tailor the information depending on the skill used; Streetwise may mean the character learns about the information from an ad hoc network of street urchins, while Knowledge (Underworld) may mean the character draws on their own vast knowledge about criminal enterprise to discover a previously unseen clue.
