Description: The character may take a Field Commander action. By successfully passing anÂ **Average Leadership check**, a number of allies equal to their presence may immediately perform one maneuver. This does not count against the number of maneuvers they may perform in their turn. If there are any questions as to the order in which allies act, the character using Field Commander is the final arbiter.
