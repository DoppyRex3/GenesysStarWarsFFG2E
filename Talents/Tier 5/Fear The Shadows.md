# Fear The Shadows
Tier: 5
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (Action)
Ranked: No
Description: The character may perform the Fear the Shadows action. They make a **Hard Deception check** targeting a single minion group or rival within long range. If they succeed, that minion group or rival flees the encounter. At the GM's discretion, these NPCs may not flee due to extenuating circumstances (such as if there is no realistic path or means to leave the encounter, or if the only way to leave the encounter may result in their deaths from a dangerous fall or lethal atmosphere). A character who has purchased this talent automatically gains 1 Conflict at the beginning of a game session.
