# Thunderous Applause
Tier: 5
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (Action)
Ranked: No
Description: Once per Encounter, the character may take a Thunderous Applause action to make a **Hard Deception Check**. If Successful, a number of NPC's (Rivals, Nemesis, Player Characters), equal to the characters force rating, support one of the character's view points, and are willing to conduct small favours for the character.

At the GM's discretion, this talent may not be able to target certain NPCs whose adversarial nature is vital to the plot, or NPCs who would be unable to appreciate the character's work such as non-sentient creatures, labor droids, and Imperial Stormtroopers.
