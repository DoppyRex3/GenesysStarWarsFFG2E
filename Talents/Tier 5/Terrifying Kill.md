# Terrifying Kill
Tier: 5
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (Maneuver)
Ranked: No
Description: The character may spend one Destiny Point to perform a Terrifying Kill maneuver immediately after conducting a successful attack where the target is incapacitated or suffers a Critical Injury (the character must still be able to perform maneuvers, and may not perform more than two maneuvers in a turn). The character rolls Force dice no greater than their uncommitted Force rating, and may spend a Force point to inflict 1 strain on any characters within short range of that target (and may do so multiple times).

A character who has purchased this talent automatically gains 1 Conflict at the beginning of a game session.
