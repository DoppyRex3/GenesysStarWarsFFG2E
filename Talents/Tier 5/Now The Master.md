Description: Once per session, the character may choose any one character in the current encounter and one talent or Force power that the target character possesses. For the remainder of the encounter, the character counts as having that talent or Force power. If the character selects a ranked talent, they count as having ranks in that talent equal to the number of ranks in that talent that the target possesses. If the character selects a Force power, they count as having the same number and type of upgrades that the target possesses. A character who has purchased this talent automatically gains 1 Conflict at the beginning of a game session.
