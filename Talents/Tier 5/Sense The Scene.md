Description: Once per session, the character may perform the Sense the Scene action. They make a **Hard Perception check** while present at a single crime scene (or similar location), adding a Force dice no greater than their Force rating to the check. If they succeed and generate a Force point, they may identify the emotional state of one person involved in the crim (such as the perpetrator or victim). They may spend an additional Force point to identify the emotional state of one additional person involved in the crime, and may do so multiple times.
