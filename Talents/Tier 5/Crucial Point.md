# Crucial Point
Tier: 5
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (Incidental) 
Ranked: No
Description: Once per session during ongoing negotiations, the character may perform the Crucial Point incidental to introduce one potential concession that an opponent will do nearly anything to obtain. This can only take place during an encounter featuring the Negotiation skill. Such encounters can range from a high-level diplomatic conference to the negotiation of payment for a job, but should not include social interactions featuring other social skills such as Barter, Charm, Coercion, or Deception.

What the concession is should be up to the player and GM. It should be something that one party is willing to give up or exchange, and it should be something concrete (such as a new trade deal or the offer of a used speeder to get a deal on a new one). The lengths the other party is willing to go to are dependent on the scenario, and may range from offering a drastic decrease in price to agreeing to an immediate cease-fire in an ongoing conflict. At minimum, the difficulty of further Negotiation checks should be decreased.

At the GM's discretion, there may be some things that no reasonable sentient will do. Killing oneself to obtain a concession, selling a planet into slavery, and surrendering the Rebel Alliance to the Empire are all examples of this
