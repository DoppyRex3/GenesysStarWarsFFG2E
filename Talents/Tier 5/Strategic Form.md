Description: While wielding a Lightsaber weapon, the character may take the Strategic Form action, making a **Hard Lightsaber (Intellect) check** and rolling Force dice no greater than Force rating as part of the check. For each success, one target within short range of the character may only make combat checks if those combat checks target the character until the end of the following round. The character may spend a Force point to cause Strategic Form to affect a target for one additional round. The effects of Strategic Form end if the character is incapacitated.
