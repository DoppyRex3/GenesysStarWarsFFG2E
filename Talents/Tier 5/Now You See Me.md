# Now You See Me
Tier: 5
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (Action)
Ranked: No
Description: Once per session the character may take the Now You See Me action, making a **Hard Deception** **check**. If successful, a number of NPCs equal to their Cunning within medium range forget any interactions they had with the character during the last thirty minutes.

At the GM's discretion, multiple threat or despair results may give the NPCs in question unpleasant side effects, such as confusion, nightmares, or a persistent and maddening suspicion that they've forgotten something important.
