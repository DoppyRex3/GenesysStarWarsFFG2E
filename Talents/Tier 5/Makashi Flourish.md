Description: Once per encounter, the character may take the Makashi Flourish action, making anÂ **Average Lightsaber (Presence) check**. If it is successful, one engaged opponent suffers strain equal to successes (ignoring soak), and the character recovers an equal amount of strain. The character may also spend three advantage or a triumph result generated on the check to stagger the opponent until the end of the target's next turn.
