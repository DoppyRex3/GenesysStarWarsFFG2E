Description: When making a Brawl check against a living opponent, the character may choose to forgo dealing damage as wounds, instead dealing the equivalent damage as strain, plus additional strain equal to their ranks in Medicine. These checks cannot be made with any weapons, but this strain damage is not reduced by soak.
