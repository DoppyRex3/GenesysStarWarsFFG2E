Description: The character may take the Far Strike action, making a Brawl combat check as a ranged attack at one target at short range or further, adding Force dice no greater than the character's Force rating to the check. The character may spend a Force point to increase the range of the attack by one range band per Force point spent, to a maximum of long. If the target is at medium range or further, the character must both sufficiently increase the range of the attack and succeed on the check to hit the target.
