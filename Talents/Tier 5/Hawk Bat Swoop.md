Description: The character may take a Hawk Bat Swoop action, performing a Lightsaber (Agility) melee combat check against one target within short range and adding Force dice no greater than Force rating to the pool. The character may spend a Force point before resolving the success or failure of the check to engage the target immediately as an incidental, and may spend a Force point to add an advantage result to the check. If the character cannot move to engage the target, the attack automatically misses.
