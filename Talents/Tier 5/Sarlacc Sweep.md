# Sarlacc Sweep
Tier: 5
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (Action)
Ranked: No
Description: The character may take the Sarlacc Sweep action, making a Lightsaber combat check with +1 difficulty against one engaged target. The character may spend one advantage result generated by this combat check to hit one additional target they are engaged with. They may do this once per engaged target, paying one advantage result for each additional hit.

When performing a Sarlacc Sweep action, the character must always target the opponent with the highest difficulty and highest defense (if two targets have the same difficulty and defense, the GM chooses which target is the initial target).
