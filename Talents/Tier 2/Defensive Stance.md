Description: Once per round on the character's turn, the character may perform a Defensive Stance manoeuvre to defend against incoming melee attacks. They then suffer a number of strain no greater than their ranks in Defensive Stance. Until the start of the character's next turn, upgrade the difficulty of all melee combat checks targeting the character a number of times equal to the strain suffered by the character this way.
