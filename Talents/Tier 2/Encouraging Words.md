Activation: Active (Out Of Turn, Incidental)
Ranked: No
Description: When an ally within short range fails a check, the character may suffer 1 strain. If so, the character may assist the next check that an ally makes this encounter as an out-of-turn incidental (rather than as a maneuver). The GM has final say as to which actions can benefit from such assistance if the character is farther than engaged range.
