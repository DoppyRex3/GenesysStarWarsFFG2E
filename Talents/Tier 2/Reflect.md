Tier: 2
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)
Ranked: Yes
Description: When the character suffers a hit from a Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), or Gunnery combat check, and after damage is calculated (but before soak is applied, so immediately after step 3 ofÂ **Perform a Combat Check**) they may take the Reflect incidental. They suffer 3 strain and reduce the damage dealt by a number equal to 2 plus their ranks in Reflect. This talent may only be used once per hit and when the character is wielding a Lightsaber weapon.
