# Impossible Fall
Tier: 4
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (Out Of Turn, Incidental)
Ranked: No
Description: Once per session, when the character is falling, they may perform the Impossible Fall incidental. They make a Force power check and may spend a Force point to land somewhere safe, such as on a pile of empty boxes in a street or a muddy spot in the middle of a lava field. The character may then spend additional Force points to reduce the effects of the fall by one range band, and may do so multiple times.
