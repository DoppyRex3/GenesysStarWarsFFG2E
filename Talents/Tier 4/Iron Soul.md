Description: If a character is carrying items that total 3 encumbrance or less (after factoring in reductions such as for armour being worn), at the end of the encounter they heal 25 strain.

If a character normally carries items that total more than 3 encumbrance but discards or otherwise loses those items temporarily, the GM can rule that the character still does not gain the benefits of Iron Soul.
