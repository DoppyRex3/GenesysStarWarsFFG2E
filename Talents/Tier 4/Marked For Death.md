# Marked For Death
Tier: 4
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (Maneuver)
Ranked: No
Description: The character may take the Marked for Death maneuver, selecting one target and committing a Force dice. The character adds three automatic advantage results to combat checks against that target while a Force dice remains committed, but cannot use the Marked for Death talent again until, the original target is incapacitated, or the session ends. 

Advantage results gained in this way cannot be used to recover strain.
