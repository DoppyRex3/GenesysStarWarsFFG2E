Description: Once per encounter, the character may take the Stand Firm! action, making aÂ **Hard Leadership check**. If the check is successful, the character chooses one ally within medium range for each success on the check. Until the end of the encounter, chosen allies increase their wound threshold by an amount equal to the character's Presence rating. (Multiple uses of this talent are not cumulative.)
