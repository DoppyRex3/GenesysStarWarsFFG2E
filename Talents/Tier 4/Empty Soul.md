Quality: Base
Activation: Passive
Ranked: No
Description: If the character is carrying items that total 3 encumbrance or less (after factoring in reductions such as for armour being worn), whenever they make a Force power check, they Force pips added from attuned crystals.

If a character normally carries items that total more than 3 encumbrance but discards or otherwise loses those items temporarily, the GM can rule that the character still does not gain the benefits of Empty Soul.
