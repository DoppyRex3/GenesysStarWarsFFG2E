# Sniper Shot
Tier: 4
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (maneuver)
Ranked: Yes
Description: Once per round before making a non-thrown ranged attack, the character may perform a maneuver to attempt a Sniper Shot. Sniper Shot increases the maximum range of their ranged weapon up to one range band per rank. For each rank beyond the normal maximum of the weapon, upgrade the difficulty of the check by one (this is in addition to the increased difficulty of the shot due to longer range).
