Description: The character may take a Draw Closer action, making a Lightsaber (Willpower) melee combat check against one silhouette 1 (or smaller) target within medium range and adding a number of Force dice no greater than Force rating to the check. The character may spend Force points before resolving the success or failure of the check to move the target one range band closer to the character (including from short to engaged). [They] may also spend a Force point to add success results to the combat check. If the character cannot move [their] target to engage [them], the combat check automatically misses.
