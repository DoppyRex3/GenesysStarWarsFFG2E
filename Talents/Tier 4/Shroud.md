Ranked: No
Description: Once per session, the character may spend one Destiny Point to make themselves undetectable via the Force (through abilities such as the Sense power) and to make their own Force powers unnoticeable for the remainder of the encounter.

What this entails exactly is up to the player and the GM, and the GM may rule that some actions (such as lifting an X-wing with one's mind) are too obvious to be ignored. However, abilities such as manipulating control panels, lifting small objects, or using Force powers to affect someone physically or mentally go unnoticed, or the effects are attributed to something else.
