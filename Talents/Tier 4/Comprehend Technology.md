Tier: 4
Quality: Base
Activation: Active (Action)
Ranked: No
Description: Once Per Encounter, the character may take the Comprehend Technology action, making an **Average Knowledge (Education) check** to intuitively understand one weapon, armor set, or other piece of personal gear. Success means that for the remainder of the encounter, when the character makes any skill checks to use or repair the item, they may count their ranks in the applicable skill as equal to their Force rating.

For example, a character may use Comprehend Technology to count their ranks in Mechanics as equal to their Force rating when repairing a broken lightsaber, or they can count their ranks in Ranged (Light) as equal to their Force rating when firing a blaster pistol.
